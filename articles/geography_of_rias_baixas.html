<h1>The Geography of the Rias Baixas</h1>
<h2>This article featured in the September 2024 edition of Geographical
	Magazine.</h2>

<p>Nestled in Spain’s north-west region of Galicia is the little-known area of
	Rías Baixas. It more closely resembles the green fields and rocky coast of
	Ireland than the dry Castilian plains, and in fact the Gallaeci were originally
	a Celtic people. From the iron age they occupied the territory of modern
	Galicia and up until just over 1000 years ago they lived in fortified villages
	now called castros, ranging from small villages to great hillforts. Many of
	these, such as O Facho de Donon are still very much in evidence today.

	The coastal landscape of Rías Baixas is irregular, marked by a series of jagged
	and sheltered fjörd-shaped inlets known as “rías”. The rías are estuaries that
	mix fresh and salt water to sustain perhaps the world’s richest maritime life.
</p>

<p>
	Standing like sentinels across the wide entrances to the rias, the pristine
	Atlantic Islands, made up of Cíes and Ons, give shelter from the Atlantic
	swell. The size and shape of the rías and the position of the Atlantic Islands
	creates the perfect conditions for sailing. And with restricted visitor numbers
	and the difficulty of getting there, the islands themselves are peaceful
	wonders of nature and topography.

<p>The soils of Rías Baixas are dominated by an extremely high level of
	minerality and acidity making it particularly suitable for viticulture. Growing
	grapes and making wine has been going on here, mostly on a very small scale,
	since Roman times. There are thousands of small vineyards and over a hundred
	wineries around Rías Baixas, which is particularly well known for its Albariño
	wines.
</p>

<p>The climate of the area is characterized by moderate year-round temperatures,
	ocean breezes and a higher-than-average annual rainfall. However, the summer
	season in Galicia is significantly drier and sunnier, and it is then that we
	are providing our 5- and 6-night cultural sailing tours. With lower summer
	temperatures than the hot south, this part of Spain is perfect for anyone
	wanting to avoid the extreme heat.</p>

<p>Join us in summer 2025 to experience at first hand the Rías Baixas area of
	Galicia on board our 42ft yacht ‘Marta'. Throughout next summer our skipper
	Tom, with his many years of experience of both sailing and the Rías Baixas,
	will be taking our second season of coastal cruises for small groups,
	accommodated in our yacht's 3 double cabins. Fly to Vigo, Santiago de
	Compostela or Porto and join us on board in the historic town of Combarro. From
	there, under sail, we will explore the crystal-clear waters and peaceful inlets
	of this fascinating coast. We will spend nights at anchor and nights moored in
	a comfortable and well-appointed marina in Combarro or the beautiful resort of
	Baiona. Our flexible itinerary will afford ample opportunities to step ashore
	to enjoy the amazing seafood, to explore villages, towns, islands, forests,
	hillforts, lighthouses, wildlife and vineyards.</p>
