        <h2>Course overview</h2>
        <p>
            <b>5-day course</b> delivered exclusively by Spain Sailing in the Atlantic waters of the rugged Galician
            coast.<br>
            <b>Tailored</b> to meet the needs of real world cruising skippers, based on years of experience, it is much
            more than just a basic crew course or “box ticking” exercise.<br>
            <b>Onboard our 40ft Sailing Cruiser</b> ‘Santa Marta’ learn the seamanship skills needed to become a
            confident
            crew member, a reliable watch-keeper, and an asset in emergency situations.<br>
            <b>Course includes</b> live recovery of a man overboard, night-time watch-keeping and use of spinnaker
            poles,
            all whilst exploring the incredible coves and inlets of the Spanish Rias.<br>
            <b>Satisfactory completion</b> of the course leads to a ‘Crew’ certificate which you can present to any
            skipper
            for whom you wish to work. It lists all that you have learned and experienced.

        <h2>Your Instructor</h2>
        <p>Tom will be your instructor. He is rated RYA Yachtmaster Instructor and he has many years teaching experience
            at sailing schools across the globe. Tom has sailed to South America, crossed the Atlantic single-handed and
            competed in the hugely challenging Fastnet Race. Residing in Galicia, Tom is very familiar with the Rias
            Baixas region and speaks Spanish fluently. </p>
        <h2>Course ethics</h2>
        <p>The idea for the Long Distance Yacht Crew course developed during many years of teaching and tens of
            thousands of miles of cruising onboard sailing yachts.
            Willing volunteers have always been pretty easy to find but good, capable crew members are few and far
            between. Most crewing courses only focus on the basic skills needed to be useful on a weekend day-sail in
            favourable conditions. And then immediately advance on to skippering roles. The problem here is that
            everyone becomes a “qualified skipper” before they’ve really put the time in and learned the real, practical
            skills of good seamanship.
            The Long Distance Yacht Crew syllabus is based on what skippers would want their crew members to have
            experience of. Especially if embarking on a delivery or a longer cruise to an as yet undiscovered
            destination.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Who is the course designed for?</h2>
        <p>People with little or no sailing experience who want to learn new skills and have an adventure<br>
            People thinking about working in the sailing industry<br>
            People looking to develop their RYA Competent Crew skills<br>
            People thinking about becoming sailing yacht skippers<br>
            Solo travellers<br>
            Boat hitch-hikers<br>
            Adventurers and outdoor enthusiasts</p>

            <img src="assets/images/marta_inside.png">
        </div>
        <h2>Fantastic training environment!</h2>
        <p>The Rias Baixas area contains everything we need, from open Atlantic rollers, sheltered coves and anchorages.
            Tom’s philosophy when teaching is that everyone learns better when they feel comfortable and relaxed. He
            strives to create an environment in which everyone feels happy to have a go and learn from their mistakes in
            a friendly and non-judgemental atmosphere.
            The LDYC course is not a “box-ticking” exercise. It's an opportunity to gain real, practical experience in
            Europe’s most interesting sailing grounds.</p>
