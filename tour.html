          Our tours begin and end in our home marina in the historic town of
          Combarro. Each day we will aim to spend between 1 and 3 hours sailing.
          The 6-night tours are group bookings and don't have to follow a
          specific schedule, but our
          <b>5-night tours</b>
          are scheduled as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 1:</b>
          Arrive in Combarro after 3pm and make yourselves at home on board our
          yacht Marta. Spend the first night moored in Combarro, after dining in
          the old town.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 2:</b>
          Set sail to explore the rias. Spend the second night at anchor off a
          beach.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 3:</b>
          Sail to Baiona to moor in the marina for the third night, and take
          your pick of some superb bars and restaurants
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 4:</b>
          Set sail to do more exploring in the rias (estuaries) and choose
          another place to anchor for the night.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Day 5:</b>
          Sail into Combarro to moor in the marina for the final night.

          Combarro combines a magnificent historic village with a modern
          bustling town and marina. It's big enough to have plenty of bars and
          restaurants and a supermarket, and close enough to Pontevedra to make
          it easy to get to from Santiago and Vigo. The atmospheric old town,
          with its narrow streets and cloistered pavements makes it a wonderful
          place to stroll in the evenings and relax in a bar or restaurant. And
          it is only a two-minute walk from the marina. For a slightly longer
          walk the beautiful Monastario de Poio is about half an hour along the
          coast. For the more adventurous runners and walkers the forested hills
          behind the town are full of interesting paths and tracks. We also
          thoroughly recommend taking a 15-minute taxi ride to the wonderful
          Attis winery, where you can wander around vineyards and admire the
          incredible views over the Salnés Valley, the heart of the Rias Baixas
          wine-growing region. It's only a few minutes by bus or taxi from
          Pontevedra the provincial capital.

          There's Barra beach, with its lovely walk around the three lighthouses
          and up to the Celtic remains at O Facho. The incredible Cíes Islands
          with their rugged rocky coast, beautiful white sandy beaches,
          crystal-clear waters, wildlife, lighthouses, and panoramic views of
          the Atlantic Ocean and the Galician coastline. There's the inlet at
          Aldan, with the quiet village and harbour and walks beyond. You'll
          definitely want to explore the ruins of the fairy forest! The Atlantic
          Island of Ons offers a quite different experience to that of Cíes.
          Less rugged, but no less beautiful, and with plenty to explore. One of
          the joys of sailing is that you can just spot a lovely place and
          decide to drop anchor. And there are plenty of places to choose from
          in Rias Baixas.

          Baiona is, without doubt, the jewel of Rias Baixas. This wonderul
          historic town, with its busy narrow streets full of architectural
          interest, is focused around the 11th century Monterreal Castle and the
          marina alongside. Baiona is a very relaxed family-friendly place, with
          bars and restaurants along the seafront and tucked away in the winding
          stone streets behind, and a brilliant children's playground right next
          to the castle. You can walk around the castle walls admiring the views
          of the sea; the sheltered bay on one side, and the exposed Atlantic
          breakers on the other. Above the town, the forested hills hide gems
          such as the statue of the Virgin of the Rock and the charming Baiona
          river. This is a paradise if you enjoy exploring woodland walks;
          modern technology enables you to explore with the confidence that you
          won't get lost. The most thrilling way to approach Baiona is from the
          sea, sailing through the narrow gap between the imposing rocky shores
          of the Wake Islands and the Monteferro promontory. Then relax and
          breath again as you enter the sheltered bay of Baiona, dominated by
          its castle. Baiona was the the first European port to receive news of
          Columbus's discovery of the Americas in 1493. You can visit a full
          scale replica of Columbus's Pinta, which is permanently moored
          alongside the marina.

          The region's coastal influence and moderate climate combined with the
          soil create perfect conditions for cultivating grapes. The Albariño
          grape produces crisp, vibrant white wines with citrus and floral
          notes. With around 200 wineries and thousands of vineyards the Rías
          Baixas presents a thriving, and very traditional industry. Many
          wineries are in the coastal towns and villages and they are often
          based in wonderful ancient buildings with incredible heritage.
          Albariño is the perfect pairing for the fresh, local seafood pulled
          from the cold waters of the Atlantic and the uniquely mixed fresh and
          sea waters where bateas are used to harvest mussels and other
          shellfish. Goose barnacles (known as percebes) are a local speciality.
          It's not just the marvellous taste, but also the adventurous catching
          of percebes that contributes to their fame. They are hunted by
          so-called 'percebeiros' (barnacle hunters) who risk their lives
          scraping the barnacles from the peaky rocks as the wild ocean pounds
          them.

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Visa:</b> For 2025 and beyond you will also need to apply for a

            The cost of the tour doesn't include flights but we're happy to help
            plan your trip. You can fly to Vigo, Santiago de Compostela or Porto
            and either use public transport, taxi or hire a car to join us on
            board in Combarro Marina. The buses and trains are cheap and well
            run and enable you to absorb more of the culture of the area.
            However, taxis are easily available at all the airports and stations
            and are considerably quicker and more convenient.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>Santiago de Compostela Airport (SCQ):</b> The cheapest way of
            getting from Santiago Airport to Combarro requires 3 bus trips (1 -
            Airport to the Estacion de Autobuses in Santiago, 2 - bus to
            Estacion de Pontevedra, 3 - bus to Combarro) which takes around 3
            hours and costs around 8€. The quickest way is by taxi which takes
            about an hour and costs approximately 80€.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>Vigo Airport (VGO):</b> The cheapest way of getting from Vigo
            Airport to Combarro is by bus. There are some direct buses but
            usually the journey will require 3 bus trips (1 - Airport to the
            Estacion Intermodal in Vigo, 2 - bus to Estacion de Pontevedra, 3 -
            bus to Combarro) which takes around 2 hours and costs around 5€. The
            quickest way is by taxi which takes about half an hour and costs
            approximately 60€.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>Porto Airport (OPO):</b> The cheapest way of getting from Porto
            Airport to Combarro is by bus or train to Vigo, then bus to
            Pontevedra and bus to Combarro which takes around 3-4 hours,
            depending on changeover times, and costs around 15€. It's nearly 2
            hours by car so it would probably be prohibitively expensive to get
            a taxi all the way. However, train or bus to Vigo and taxi to
            Combarro would probably work out as a good compromise.

            Our yacht has 3 double cabins for our guests, each with a double
            bed. Bed clothes and towels will be provided and there are small
            wardrobes and cupboards for your things. The two stern (rear) cabins
            have en-suite facilities. The forward cabin shares a bathroom with
            Skipper Tom. If you book a single cabin it will be one of the
            en-suite cabins unless there is only the forward cabin left
            unbooked. In this case we will make the situation clear before
            booking.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bathrooms all contain a toilet, sink and shower. There are
            excellent washing facilities in the marinas too.

            You will need to be able step onto and off the boat when it is
            moored in the marina. And climb up and down the ladder-like steps
            between the saloon and the deck. You should also be able to keep
            yourself stable while the yacht is sailing. If you wish to actually
            carry out some sailing yourself then you'll be winding winches,
            standing on a moving and sloping deck and perhaps being splashed by
            the sea.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you wish to go ashore while at anchor in a sandy bay then you
            will have to be able to get into and out of the tender (small
            inflatable boat with a motor) at the yacht and at the beach or pier
            steps.

            If you have booked as an individual or a couple then you will be on
            board with people who you don't know at the beginning of the tour.
            However, our experience is that everyone gets on very well indeed
            and some fantastic friendships have been formed this way.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have booked the whole boat then the only person on board
            other than your group will be Skipper Tom.

            Only normal holiday things, but make sure you allow for the fact
            that it can be cooler and wetter at sea than on land. So bring
            waterproofs and warmer clothes than you might normally bring on a
            land-based summer trip to Spain.

            Yes! We have USB charging points on board and the signal in the area
            is excellent. Our guests have no problems using their phones for
            calls, internet or using maps, sat nav, Strada navigation etc. You
            will find your phone invaluable for exploring the woods, navigating
            and, if you don't speak Spanish, translating!
